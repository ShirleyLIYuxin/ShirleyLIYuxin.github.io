* BEng in Computer Science, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST),  2022-2026(expected)

Research project
======
* Explore Selective Disclosure Bias with Networks of LLM-based Agents (Supervised by Prof. [Yongren SHI](https://sociology.uiowa.edu/people/yongren-shi), The University of Iowa)
  * Developed a simulation to study how selective disclosure bias affects opinion segregation.
