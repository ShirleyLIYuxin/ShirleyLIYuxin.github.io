Education
======
* BEng in Computer Science, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST),  2022-2026(expected)

Research project
======
* Summer 2024: Explore Selective Disclosure Bias with Networks of LLM-based Agents (Supervised by Prof. [Yongren SHI](https://sociology.uiowa.edu/people/yongren-shi), The University of Iowa)
  * Developed a simulation to study how selective disclosure bias affects opinion segregation.
  * Modelled twenty agents with diverse opinion interaction based on perceived similarity.
  * Demonstrated that interactions with acquaintances or strangers can facilitate the spread of unpopular norms, whereas interactions with close 
friends or family may hinder information cascades.
