Hi! I am a senior undergraduate student in Computer Science at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). My research interest includes large language models, natural language processing and trustworthy machine learning. I am currently working on Formal Language for LLM reasoning.  

I am actively seeking **PhD opportunities for Fall 2026** and would be excited to explore potential collaborations. Please feel free to reach out if you have any relevant opportunities or ideas for collaboration. 

Education
======
* Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST),  2022-2026(expected)

### Explore Selective Disclosure Bias with Networks of LLM-based Agents
  (Supervised by Prof. [Yongren SHI](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4qEFbz8AAAAJ&hl=en), The University of Arizona)
  * Developed a simulation to study how selective disclosure bias affects opinion segregation.
  * Demonstrated that interactions with acquaintances or strangers can facilitate the spread of unpopular norms, whereas interactions with close 
friends or family may hinder information cascades.

Skills
======
* Python, Java, C++, LaTeX, RISC-V

Courses
======
