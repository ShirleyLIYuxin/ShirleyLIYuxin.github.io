Hi! I am a senior undergraduate student in Computer Science at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). My research interest includes large language models, natural language processing and trustworthy machine learning. I am currently working on Formal Language for LLM reasoning.  

I am actively seeking **PhD opportunities for Fall 2026** and would be excited to explore potential collaborations. Please feel free to reach out if you have any relevant opportunities or ideas for collaboration.

### \[EMNLP 2025\] Let's Reason Formally: Natural-Formal Hybrid Reasoning Enhances LLM's Math Capability [\[Paper\]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23703)
  Ruida Wang\*, **Yuxin Li**\*, Yi R. (May) Fung, Tong Zhang (\* indicates first authors)

### Explore Selective Disclosure Bias with Networks of LLM-based Agents (On-going)
  (Supervised by Prof. [Yongren SHI](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4qEFbz8AAAAJ&hl=en), The University of Arizona)
  * Developed a simulation to study how selective disclosure bias affects opinion segregation.
  * Demonstrated that interactions with acquaintances or strangers can facilitate the spread of unpopular norms, whereas interactions with close 
friends or family may hinder information cascades.
