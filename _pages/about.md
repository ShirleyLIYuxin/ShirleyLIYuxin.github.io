Hi! I am a junior undergraduate student in Computer Science at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). My research interest includes large language models, natual language processing, trustworthy machine learning, and computer vision.  

Education
======
* Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST),  2022-2026(expected)

Research project
======
* Explore Selective Disclosure Bias with Networks of LLM-based Agents
  (Supervised by Prof. [Yongren SHI](https://sociology.uiowa.edu/people/yongren-shi), The University of Iowa)
  * Developed a simulation to study how selective disclosure bias affects opinion segregation.
  * Demonstrated that interactions with acquaintances or strangers can facilitate the spread of unpopular norms, whereas interactions with close 
friends or family may hinder information cascades.

Skills
======
* Python, Java, C++, LaTex, RISC-V

Course taken
======
* Mathmetics & physics: Calculus, Multivariable Calculus, Linear Algebra, Applied Statistics, Probability, Discrete Mathematical Tools for Computer Science, General Physics with Calculus.
* Computer Science: Programming with C++, Object-Oriented Programming and Data Structures, Design and Analysis of Algorithms, Computer Architecture.
* Applied Mathmetics & Computer Science: Fundamentals of Actuarial Mathematics, Introduction to Electro-Robot Design, Introduction of Industrial Engineering and Decision Analytics.
