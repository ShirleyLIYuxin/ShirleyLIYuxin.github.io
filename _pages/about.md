Hi! I am a rising junior undergraduate student in Computer Science at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). While my primary research interests broadly encompass machine learning, I am currently focused on exploring topics related to large language models, particularly LLM agents. Recently, I am collaborating with Prof. [Yongren SHI](https://sociology.uiowa.edu/people/yongren-shi) on integrating large language models and agent-based models to explore sociological phenomena. 

Education
======
* BEng in Computer Science, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST),  2022-2026(expected)

Research project
======
* Explore Selective Disclosure Bias with Networks of LLM-based Agents (Supervised by Prof. [Yongren SHI](https://sociology.uiowa.edu/people/yongren-shi), The University of Iowa)
  * Developed a simulation to study how selective disclosure bias affects opinion segregation.
  * Demonstrated that interactions with acquaintances or strangers can facilitate the spread of unpopular norms, whereas interactions with close 
friends or family may hinder information cascades.

Skills
======
* Python, Java, C++, LaTex, RISC-V

Course taken
======
* MATH: Calculus, Multivariable Calculus, Linear Algebra, Applied Statistics, Probability, Discrete Mathematical Tools for Computer Science.
* COMP: Programming with C++, Object-Oriented Programming and Data Structures, Design and Analysis of Algorithms, Computer Architecture.
* Others: Fundamentals of Actuarial Mathematics, General Physics with Calculus, Introduction to Electro-Robot Design, Introduction of Industrial Engineering and Decision Analytics.
