Hi! I am a rising junior undergraduate student in Computer Science at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). During my Sophomore fall semester, I worked with Prof. [Minhao CHENG](https://cmhcbb.github.io/). I am now working with Prof. [Yongren SHI](https://sociology.uiowa.edu/people/yongren-shi) in Large Language Models and Agent-Based Models.
